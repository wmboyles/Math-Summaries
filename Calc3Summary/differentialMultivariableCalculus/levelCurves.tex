\section{Level Curves}
\noindent
We can look at different cross sections of a surface $f(x,y)$ by looking at the equation $f(x,y)=c$ where $c\in\mathbb{R}$. This curve lives in the xy-plane and is called the C-level curve. We often visualize these curves in the $z=c$ plane as part of the surface. In higher dimensions, like $f(x,y,z)$, a C-level curve becomes a C-level surface.

For example, the C-level surface of $f(x,y,z)=e^{-\left(x^2+y^2+z^2\right)}$ is the sphere centered at the origin with radius $\sqrt{-\ln{c}}$: $x^2+y^2+z^2=-\ln{c}$.
